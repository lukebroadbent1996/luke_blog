            <p class="zeldatitle">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</p>
            <p class="zeldatext">Breath of the wild is without a doubt the best zelda game Nintendo have ever released. From your first seconds booting up the game you are thrown in to the vast landscapes of Hyrule. The land is full of immensley fun and complex hidden puzzles, enemy camps, hidden treasure and abilities for you to discover.</p>

            <p class="witchertitle">The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt</p>
            <p class="witchertext">The Witcher 3 is the most dense and deep out of the 3 games in the series, with an overwhelmingly massive open-world enviroment players can pretty much do what you want. The witcher 3's landscape is one of the most authentic-feeling open worlds I have ever seen. The world feel so real and every choice you make impacts the world and the characters.</p>

            <p class="smitetitle">Smite</p>
            <p class="smitetext">Smite is a third person MOBA which stands for Multiplayer Online Battle Arena. This is my nerd game I play lmao. When it comes to smite you need to learn the game to be able to play it consistantly. I highly rate this game because you can play against a better player mechanically but you can out smart them to win. Very similar to LoL and DOTA 2 which are top down views instead.</p>

            <p class="pythontext">Python is a programming language i am currently learning. Python is a good language to learn first because its easier to learn than the other languages. Also knowing python is a very useful skill to have if you want to be a programmer because of its diverse usage.<br>The image on the right is a screen shot from my game I created in a team with other first time python coders. Its a game designed for lockdown so people can have a 'day out' in Manchester.</p>

Soon to the mopst important question for a football fan 'What Football team fo you support?' well the teams I support are... yes team's' im one of them.
